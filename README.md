## Installation
Refer to [INSTALL.md](doc/INSTALL.md)

## Data Preparation
Refer to [DATA_PREPARATION.md](doc/DATA_PREPARATION.md)

## Get Started
We provide scripts for training and testing on SLURM. Tensorboard records are saved in `log` directory.

You can manually launch the task using `torchrun` in the script.
### Train
```bash
cd scripts
./launch_train.sh <partition> <gpu_num> ../config/<config_name>S1.yaml <extra_tag(optional)>
```

### Finetune
```bash
./launch_finetune.sh <partition> <gpu_num> ../config/<config_name>S2.yaml ../log/<checkpoint_name>/<checkpoint>.pth.tar <extra_tag(optional)>
```

### Eval
`eval_mode: ['best', 'confident']`
```bash
./launch_eval.sh <partition> <gpu_num> ../config/<config_name>S2.yaml ../log/<checkpoint_name>/<checkpoint>.pth <eval_mode>
```


### Note
We conduct experiments in two stages: training with `*S1.yaml` and finetuning with `*S2.yaml`. One-stage training also works, but the performance is not as good as two-stage training.

Configs are named in \<dataset\>\_\<detector_type\>\_\<distribution_type\>\<stage\>.yaml. 

Further experiment code and configs, including 3D-2D mix training, single hypothesis, ... can be found in [this url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xvSfSb15O3x8PYQDm6_9Aq9RenEf5M7n?usp=sharing).

### Model Zoo
We provide the pretrained models in [this url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wv7NeFQosIutCbrO8pF2XSsgfXmRBWMZ?usp=sharing).
